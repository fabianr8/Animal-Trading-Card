			<p id = "Text">While they are not quite as large as the Siberian tiger subspecies, Bengal tigers are still formidable creatures. They are not quite as heavy as some other subspecies, but are still incredibly large cats. Most individuals are a just under 10 ft. long, and weigh around 550 lbs. or so. Like most tigers, they have reddish-orange fur, white underbellies, and black stripes.\
